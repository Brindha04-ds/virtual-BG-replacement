Virtual Background Replacement (No Green Screen)

This is a beginner-level Python project that will allow you to replace the background behind the person in a webcam image with a virtual background image - no need to use a green screen!

In this program, we access the webcam to get live video, the program detects the person using MediaPipe's Selfie Segmentation and the program replaces the background in the frame using OpenCV .

Project Purpose:

The main goal of this project is to learn and apply computer vision and AI-based human segmentation to replace backgrounds in real-time webcam footage — without needing a green screen. This simulates how popular platforms like Zoom, Teams, and OBS perform background effects.

Technologies Used:
Packages used ,
"opencv-python" -Used to access your webcam, process the frames, and display the images back to the screen .
"mediapipe" -Uses AI in the background to perform a segmentation task to detect the human in the frame .
"numpy" -Used to blend the original frame containing the human and the other frame created from the virtual background 

Setup Instructions :
1. Open up PyCharm: 
 Create a project folder 
2. Add a background image : 
 Save your virtual background image in the project folder - Call it: "background.jpg"
 3.Install requirements :
 Open the "Terminal" in PyCharm and type, 
" pip install opencv -python mediapipe numpy"
Run the Python file
 
These are the basic steps to follow through to run the program and stop it.

-Open projectname.py 
-Click the green Run button 
-Press q to quit the webcam window

Real-World Usage

This project demonstrates core concepts used in:

 Video conferencing apps like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams

Live streaming platforms such as OBS Studio and Streamlabs

Virtual classrooms where background privacy is essential

Augmented reality (AR) applications and social media filters

Security systems where foreground/background distinction is needed By combining Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, you're learning the same principles used in professional-grade products.

Conclusion:

This Virtual Background Replacement project is a powerful beginner project that teaches:

Real-time webcam capture

AI-powered segmentation

Background manipulation using OpenCV

No green screen, no expensive software — just Python and creativity.

As you grow, this project can evolve into:

A live virtual camera app

A fun face filter generator

A background blur or motion effect tool
